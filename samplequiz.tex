\noindent \textbf{Directions:\footnote{more questions on the back.}} SHOW ALL WORK. You may use \texttt{R} for
computations, but no other software (and in particular, not the
Internet). If you use \texttt{R} to calculate something, then hand-write the
\texttt{R} code that you typed, together with the numerical answer.

\section[The following table categorizes a group of people based on the flavor of Kool-Aid they drink and whether or not they like President Barack Obama.]{The following table categorizes a group of people based on the flavor of Kool-Aid they drink and whether or not they like President Barack Obama.}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
 & grape & orange & cherry & Total\\
\hline
likes Obama & 92 & 93 & 29 & 214\\
doesn't like Obama & 84 & 64 & 51 & 199\\

Our experiment will be to select one (1) person from the table out
of the 413 people, at random.

\section[We would like to feed baby ``Aidan''. At the dinner table, we get a spoon of food and make an airplane \emph{swoop} as we move the spoon toward his mouth.]{We would like to feed baby ``Aidan''.

Calling the event \( E = \left\{ \mbox{take a bite}\right\} \) a
``success'', it has been determined by experimentation that on any
given airplane swoop, the probability of success is \(p \approx\)
0.39. Suppose that Aidan is in the high chair. Let \(Y\) denote the
number of failed swoops (\(E^{c}=\left\{ \mbox{no bite}\right\}\))
before the first 6 successful bites.

\subsection[If the successive swoops were to constitute independent Bernoulli trials, what would be the distribution of \(Y\)? You should write the family name of the distribution and numerical value(s) of a(ny) parameter(s).]{If the successive swoops were to constitute independent Bernoulli trials, what would be the distribution of \(Y\)?
