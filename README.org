* What you need
- a suitably recent version of [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] (I'm running version 8.0-pre).
- a suitably recent version of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] (I'm running version
  24.3.50.1).
- a version of [[http://www.r-project.org][R]] plus the R package [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/distrEx/index.html][distrEx]] (and its dependencies) for
  this particular quiz.
- Org-mode configured suitably.  Have a look at =dotemacs.el= for the
  relevant parts of my =.emacs=.
- the file =samplequiz.org= somewhere you can find it.
- the file =examformat.tex= in the same place as =samplequiz.org=.
  Alternatively, you can insert each of the lines of =examformat.tex=
  at the top of the =.org= file, like this:
  : #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[letterpaper, margin=1in]{geometry}
  and so forth.

* What you can do
If you would like to 
- generate the quiz (without answers), open the file and do
  : C-c C-e l o
- generate the quiz (with answers), first change the line
  : #+EXCLUDE_TAGS: answer
  to the following
  : #+EXCLUDE_TAGS: space
  then put point up at the top of the file and do
  : C-c C-c
  (this refreshes the local setup) then do
  : C-c C-e l o
- tangle (most of) the R code, do
  : C-c C-v t
- run the code interactively, put point somewhere in a code block
  (which starts with =#+BEGIN_SRC R=) and do
  : C-c C-c
- export the exam (with answers or not) to HTML (yes, that's right,
  HTML) then do
  : C-c C-e h h
  /Note:/ a few spots of this particular quiz don't show up very well
  in HTML. But, as you will see, a quiz that was even a little bit
  simpler than this one would show up just fine.
