* What you need
- a version of =R=, plus the =R= package =distrEx= (and its dependencies) for this particular quiz.
- a suitably recent version of [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] (I'm running version 23.1.1).
- a suitably recent version of [[http://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]] (I'm running version 7.5.74).
- Org-mode configured suitably.  Have a look at =dotemacs.el= for the relevant parts of my =.emacs=. 
- the file =samplequiz.org= somewhere you can find it.
- the file =examformat.tex= in the same place as =samplequiz.org=.  Alternatively, you can insert each of the lines of =examformat.tex= at the top of the =.org= file, like this:
  : #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[letterpaper]{geometry}
  and so forth.

* What you can do

If you would like to 

- generate the exam (without answers), do
  : C-c C-e d

- generate the exam (with answers), first delete the line
  : #+EXPORT_EXCLUDE_TAGS: answer
  then do
  : C-c C-e d
  /Note:/ sometimes it takes a couple runs to get everything.
- tangle (most of) the R code, do
  : C-c C-v t

- run the code interactively, put point somewhere in a code block (which starts with =#+begin_src R=) and do
  : C-c C-c

- export the exam (with answers or not) to HTML (yes, that's right, HTML) then do
  : C-c C-e b
  /Note:/ a few spots of this particular quiz don't show up very well in HTML. But, as you will see, a quiz that was even a little bit simpler than this one would show up just fine.  The tricky part is the substituted code that students type, currently typeset with a custom =studinpt= environment.
